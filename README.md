# Simple Chat Bot with Java (Hyperskill Project)
Digital personal assistants help people drive cars, plan their day, and buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

In this project, you will develop, step by step, a simple bot that will help you study programming.

## Feedback on the project
This project was a great hands‑on way to reinforce the fundamentals of Java. I practiced working with constants, methods, loops, conditionals, and user input using the Scanner class. Building the bot stage by stage helped to understand how to structure a program into small, reusable functions and keep the code clean.
One of the most interesting parts was using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to calculate the user’s age from remainders (don’t worry, you don’t have to do the math yourself, but it’s fascinating to research how it works). 
It was a simple but effective project for strengthening problem‑solving skills, practicing formatted output, and learning how to make a console program interactive.
